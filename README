Sheba, a smoke tester for Parrot (and possibly other things)
============================================================

Sheba is a little command-line application for automatically smoke-testing
Parrot under various configurations.

It provides two interfaces:

sheba.pl   -- builds and tests various configurations of the Parrot source tree
              in the current directory.
nicaule.pl -- like the above, but integrates with Git.  Automatically pulls the
              latest changes, and tests one or more branches in turn.
